# Abstract 
The aim of our work is to apply relevant concepts of Time Series Analysis for daily closing stock price prediction of *Indus Tower Limited*. At first we tried to predict the mean behavior of the data set using appropriate AR, MA and ARIMA models. Thereafter, we have used Hybrid ARIMA-ARCH and Hybrid ARIMA-GARCH to capture the volatility of the series.
